### Create Challenge
_Review and create your challenge_

#### Testing Scenarios - Choose ONE
Before creating the challenge, we are going to ask you to test one of the following scenarios below that will not allow you to proceed with the creation. You only need to perform _one_ of these scenarios; you will not be able to provide feedback on more than one of these scenarios.
* **Remove Text Box**: Scroll to any of the Title, Tagline, or Description Text Box Inputs and delete the text you have entered. Scroll back down and try to re-submit - you should not advance to the Success screen. Scroll back to the text entry box that you deleted information from and you should see red text appear beneath the text entry box. Re-input your information (or something similar). 
* **Delete Dynamic Field**: Delete all of one of Guidelines, Judging Criteria, or Prizes. Scroll back down and try to re-submit - you should not advance to the Success screen. You should be prompted to add at least one of the fields you deleted.
* **Timeline Discrepancy**: The milestones in the "Timeline" are shown in chronological order i.e. the milestone directly below another _has_ to be fall on a later date. Choose any of Sumbmission End, Voting Start, Voting End, or Winner(s) Announced and change the day to one that is earlier than the preceeding milestone. Scroll back down and try to re-submit - you should not advance to the Success screen. You should be prompted to change the date of the invalid milestone. Select that milestone and change the date to a valid selection.

#### Create the Challenge
1. Tap the "Create Challenge" Button.
2. If any issues persist, either a banner at the bottom of your screen or red text below a text entry box should indicate which field is giving you an error. 
3. If you were successful, you should see a success screen showing the title of your challenge and the timeframe over which it is being conducted. 

## ‚úîÔ∏è View and Verify your Challenge
_Review the idea you submitted and ensure all the information is correct_
1. If you are still on the submission success screen, you should see a button to take you to the challenge that you just created. If not, you will need to find your challenge.
2. **Verify Thumbnail**: Ensure the thumbnail you provided is prominently displayed as the backdrop of the page.
3. **Verify Title and Tagline**: Ensure your title is correct and the tagline/objective is correct below the title.
4. **Verify Timeline**: Ensure the dates for each of your milestones is correct.
4. **Verify Description**: Ensure the description of your idea is correct and displayed when you first navigated to the page.
